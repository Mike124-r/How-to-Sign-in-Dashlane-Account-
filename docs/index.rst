We'll show you how to login in to your Dashlane account in this article, and we'll also give you some ideas on how to keep your access safe and smooth.

Why It's Important to Sign In to Dashlane
The main job of Dashlane is to make it easier to manage passwords without putting security at risk. After you sign in, you can access:

Your vault that is encrypted

Passwords and other information that have been saved

Keep your notes and payment information safe.

VPN services (for premium plans)

Reports on the health of your passwords

Autofill works in some apps and browsers.

Dashlane has made a detailed and safe way to sign in to preserve all of this. Let's look at how it works in more detail.

How to Log In to Dashlane on the Web
To log in with a web browser, do the following:

Start up the web browser you like best.

Visit the official Dashlane login page.

Type in the email address that is linked to your account.

Type your master password after clicking Next.

You will be asked to enter a one-time code if you have turned on two-factor authentication (2FA).

If your authentication is successful, you will be sent to your vault.

If you've already installed the Dashlane browser extension, you can also sign in from the icon for the plugin.

How to log in to the app on your phone
There are also separate Dashlane apps for Android and iOS. To sign in on your phone, do this:

Get the Dashlane app from the App Store or Google Play and open it.

Type in the email address you used to sign up.

Enter your master password or use biometric authentication if you have it set up.

Finish the verification stage for 2FA.

You can see and control your vault right from your phone after you're logged in.

Biometric login, like fingerprint or facial recognition, makes it easy and safe to sign in on a mobile device.

Turning on biometric authentication
If your device can do it, turning on biometric login will save you time:

Open the Dashlane app and go to Settings.

Look for Security Options or Biometric Login.

To link your fingerprint or face recognition, follow the instructions.

You can sign in to Dashlane with just a touch or a glance the next time you open it.

Two-Factor Authentication for More Security 2FA is an excellent technique to make your login process more secure. After you input your master password, Dashlane asks for a six-digit token that an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy makes.

To get it ready:

Log in to Dashlane.

Go to Security in Settings.

Turn on Two-Factor Authentication.

Use your authenticator app to scan the QR code.

Keep backup codes in case you can't get into your phone.

Common Problems with Signing In and How to Fix Them
I forgot my master password.
Dashlane can't reset or recover your master password because it uses a zero-knowledge mechanism. If you forget it:

Use account recovery if you set it up.

If not, you might have to reset your account, which will remove everything in your vault.

Not Recognized Device
Dashlane will sometimes prompt you to confirm new devices:

Look in your inbox for an email that says you have confirmed.

To let the new device log in, click the approve link.

2FA is not working
If your authentication code doesn't work:

Make sure the time settings on your phone are the same.

If you have them, use backup codes.

Think about resetting 2FA from a device where you are already signed in.

How to Keep Your Sign-In Safe
Here are some things you can do to keep your Dashlane account safe:

Make sure your master password is strong. Don't use names, birthdates, or words from the dictionary.

Don't give your login information to anyone, including someone you trust.

Change your recovery choices in case you forget your credentials.

After using public devices, sign out.

Check your login history in your account settings on a regular basis.

Signing in on More Than One Device
Dashlane lets you sync your desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone. Check that your plan lets you use more than one device at a time. When you log in on a new device:

You might have to prove who you are via email or two-factor authentication.

All changes to data and updates will be seamlessly synced across all platforms.

Last Thoughts
Signing in to your Dashlane account is the first step to safely managing your digital life. The platform makes it easy to log in without giving up any security. The process is easy to use and safe with the newest security measures, such as two-factor authentication and biometric access, whether you use a browser or a mobile app.

You can safely log into your Dashlane account, fix frequent problems, and always have access to your encrypted vault no matter where you are by following the steps and advice above. Stay safe and organized, and let Dashlane take care of the rest.
